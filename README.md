## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- MVC Architecture

### Continued development

I'm generally focusing on how to segment large code base into small components having unidirectional flow of data between them. I've used MVC Architecture to achieve it. Moreover, declarative paradigm is something that is facinating me more, using this paradigm to the utmost is my goal.
